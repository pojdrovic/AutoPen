	build-essential can fail, try this just incase: http://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/275438/kali-linux-2-0-cant-install-build-essentials

TO DO: 
	NEED TO CHANGE ALL THE TOOLS TO DOWNLOAD STUFF INTO THEIR FOLDER so that it doesn't just throw everything in one directory (aka cd right after clone/download)
	NEED TO WRITE SCRIPTS TO IMPLEMENT ATTACKS

Front End/Back End Connection:
	We only want the whole thing to run if the install all or install all CAN button is pressed
	Else, we need to function to take in distro and the name of the tool depending on the button pressed and then install that

Note:
	ELM327:
		Be forewarned that the ELM327 has limited buffer space, so you will lose packets when sniffing,
 		and transmission can be a bit imprecise, but if you're in a pinch this is the cheapest route.

 	Make sure the user knows that this will all be cloned in the current directory aka most likely /Users/'user'


Tools may be included:
	canibus for ELM327:
		(go-server)
	CANtact:
		will provide a section in here with the github link and the website link so that the user can build their own
		Also, will possibly provide steps on how to do so (will learn how to do this first)

Note:
	RomRaider: Subaru
		Warning: RomRaider is intended for use only by experienced tuners who understand the consequences. As with any tuning solution, the potential
		for engine damage is very high when altering your ECUs hard coded values. The use of appropriate equipment (ie, knock sensor, wideband oxygen 
		sensor) is extremely important. By downloading RomRaider, you agree to assume all risks and accept its license. Use at your own risk.

Tools may be included:
	Octane:
		not made available because runs on Windows	
	AVRDUDESS:
		(this one not sure if im going to install yet)
	OpenPilot:
		Hondas and Acuras (believe this one needs specific hardware / it needs to be installed on that but maybe we can make it possible / do for them)
